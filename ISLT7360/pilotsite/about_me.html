<p>My name is Mrs. Davis and I have been an art teacher for 8 years. I earned my master's degree in Art Education at Drury University and am currently getting my specialist degree at the University of Missouri. I am married to Devon, who is a nurse, and we have a 20 month old Daughter, Arlandria-James. Teaching art is my favorite thing to do and I couldn't imagine not see all of my little artists every day! In our free time, we love to travel and go to concerts. We also have goats, cows, and llamas on our farm.</p><br>
<p>I believe that art is an extremely important part of a child's education. Art allows students to practice creativity, master fine motor skills, and think critically about the artistic process. Even my youngest artists bloom in my classroom by learning colors, lines, shapes, and composition. I aim to make each child feel successful in my classroom. Hopefully this website will help you all see how hard we work to be the best artists we can be!</p>
