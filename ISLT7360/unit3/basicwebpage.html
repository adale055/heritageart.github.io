<h1><b>Mrs. Davis's Art Room</b></h1>
<h2><b>Welcome to art at Heritage Elementary!</b></h2> 
<p>We create all kinds of amazing things in our art room! You can expect your student to practice with a variety of mediums, learn about new artists and techniques, and create a variety of artworks throughout the year. We are always working hard to learn as much about art and the artistic process as possible!</p> 
<p>School of the Osage is a special place to be. We have core values that we live by every day. These values always carry into the artroom to make us the strongest artists possible. <br>Our <u>core values</u> are: <ol>
<li>Innovation</li>
<li>Tradition</li>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Opportunity</li>
</ol>
<p>Students have the opportunity to be successful and strong through innovation and tradition and the art room is a natural place for all of these values to come together!</p>
<h2>About Mrs. Davis</h2>
<p>I grew up at Lake of the Ozarks and went to college at Drury University in Springfield. I studied architecture for 4 years before pursuing education. I have been an art teacher for 8 years at School of the Osage</p>
<p>Art and design is my passion. I love watching my students grow creatively. Each of my students is their own artist. 
<blockquote>An artist cannot fail; it is a success to be one.<br>-Charles Cooley</blockquote>
<p>I have been married for 11 years. My husband is a nurse and we have one daughter, Arlandria, who is almost 2 years old. I also have a farm with many animals!</p>
<h2> In the Art Room</h2>
Here are some of the things you can expect to learn in art this year:<dl>
<dt><b>Color</b></dt>
<dd>We start the year off learning about the basic colors. We start with primary colors, color mixing, and secondary colors and then move on to tertiary colors, warm and cool colors, and complementary colors. You can see our color song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8yuyekP_So">here</a></dd>
<dt><b>Line</b></dt>
<dd>Line is so much fun! We learn how a line is made, what different kind of lines there are, and how to make up our own lines! Check out our line song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQEVllmeWH4">here</a></dd>
<dt><b>Shape</b></dt>
<dd>Shape is our final unit in the intro to elements. We learn how we can use shape to bring our creations together! We practice 2D and 3D shapes. Our 3D shape song is our favorite! Listen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cg-Uc556-Q">now</a><dd>

<h2>Artsonia</h2>
<p>I put all student work on a website called Artsonia. It's an art museum just for kids.  Parents, you can create an account and see your child's artwork regularly! You can also support our art program by buying items from the site that feature your child's artowrk. <br>You can visit artsonia here: <a href="http://artsonia.com">Artsonia</a></p>.
