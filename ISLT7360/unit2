<h1>My H1 is my title</h1>


<p>Hello, Class! My name is ___. This is block is surrounded by paragraph tags. Paragraphs are a block level element.</p>

<p>However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new block of text, but they state that there is a meaning change. For example, <b>this text is emphasized by making it bold</b>. Sometimes we may choose to emphasize other text by <i>italicizing it</i> or <u>underlining it.</u></p>

<h2>My Lists. This is an H2 header; it is a subheading underneath H1.</h2>  

<h3>Unordered Lists (h3 heading)</h3>
