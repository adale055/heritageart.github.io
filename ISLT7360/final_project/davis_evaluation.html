<h2 style="background-color:#890000;color:#FFFFFF;">Summary of Evaluator's Comments</h2>
  <p>Overall, my evaluator's enjoyed the website. They felt like it was great that anyone could easily access the site from the district page and immediately be up to date with what is happening in the art room. They thought it was easy to navigate and easy to read. Two of my evaluator's mentioned that my navigation links were hard to read on the dark background and suggested that I change the color or add a different background. Glena liked that she could see the artwork transform from the main page and liked the idea that I invited the visitors to come back and see what we did next.</p>
  <p>Jennifer suggested that she would like to see pictures of the kids actually working on the art projects, but Kim brought up the point that this could be difficult as many students do not have permission to be posted online. This would take a lot of work on my part to keep up with has permission and who does not.</p>
