<h1 style="background-color:#890000;color:#FFFFFF;">Mrs. Davis's Design Document</h1>
<h2 style="background-color:#890000;color:#FFFFFF;">Purpose</h2> 
<p>The goal of my website is to connect parents, teachers, and the community to my art education program. I want my student's families, my collegues, my administration, and my local community members to know exactly what happens in our art room and the process of brining our creations to life.</p>
<p>My goals would be that people see exactly how much work goes into our art program and that it is invaluable to a child's whole education experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my administration could check in on our hard work since they are not able to be in the classroom as much as I would like. This will help reinforce my position as an art educator and ensure my administration I am meeting all of my expected goals.</p>
<p><b>Interview Questions:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>What would you like to see most on your child's art class website?</li>
<li>How will this website help connect you to your child's education experience?</li>
<li>What would you most like included on the website?</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>In talking with parents, I was able to see that some of them don't even know who their child's specials teachers are. This is a problem for me, because I want to be just as involved in each of my student's educational experience as their classroom teacher. The concensus was that an art website would help parents understand what goes on during their child's specials time and that we are actually teachers too.</p>
<p>It was also noted that having the lessons laid out for parents to see could really help open conversations between parents and their child about what they are doing in school. It would also help give parents the vocabulary necessary for working with their child at home on colors, shapes, lines, etc.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:#890000;color:#FFFFFF;">Design Concept</h2>

<h3><b>Audience</b></h3>
<p>My audience will mostly be parents and families ages 25-45 who live locally at the Lake of the Ozarks and have children enrolled at Heritage Elementary. They would have home internet access and have interest and involvement in their child's education.</p>

<h3><b>Reference Websites</b></h3>
<p>The following are the reference websites I chose. They are all websites by elementary art teachers across the country:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://dolvinartknight.blogspot.com">Mrs. Knight's Smartest Artists</a></li>
<li><a href="http://paintedpaperart.com">Painted Paper Art</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artedguru.com">The Art Ed Guru</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cassiestephens.blogspot.com">Cassie Stephens</a></li>
<li><a href="http://artisbasic.com">Art is Basic</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 style="background-color:#890000;color:#FFFFFF;">Presentation Information</h2>
<h3><b>Content Synopisis</b></h3>
<p>I want the content to be simple and easy to read. I also want it to be easily accessible from the main page and I want it to be easy to navigate back to the home page. I would like there to be a search bar where parents can seach by a certain lesson, topic, or grade and clear tabs to find other pages.</p>
<h3><b>Organization</b></h3>
<p>home page with photos, introduction, most recent project and blog post. A navigation to curriculum, Artsonia, the district home page, About Me, and Past Lessons.</p>
<p>Lesson page with photos, lesson description, cirriculum standards, and links to Artsonia, NEE, and DESE</p>
<p>About me page with philosophy, photos, and descriptions.</p>
<h3><b>Wireframe</b></h3>
<img src="wireframe.png" alt="wireframe" height="480" width="640">
<h3><b>Rationale</b></h3>
<p>Everything will be easily seen and accessible from the main page. I want to clearly post what information parents need to know in a streamlined manner. Visitors will be able to see everything immediately on the home page.</p>
<h3><b>Media</b></h3>
<p>Photos will be taken by me during class time and posted with signed media release from parents.<br>
Video from some projects will be taken by me during class and posted with signed media release from parents.<br>
Youtube songs and videos will be posted through links.<br>
The school logo will be present on some pages.<br>
All artwork inspriation will be credited.</p>
<h3><b>Color Scheme</b></h3>
My color scheme will follow our school colors of:<br>

<span style="color:#890000;background-color:#000000"><i>Maroon</i></span>and<span style="color:#FFFFFF;background-color:#000000"><i>White</i></span><br>
With accents of:
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#877f7f;"><i>Grey</i></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#000000;"><i>Black</i></span></li>
<li>and lighter and darker shades of <span style="color:#890000;"><i>Maroon</i></span></li>
<li><span style="color:#9a4646;"><i>LIGHT MAROON</i></span> and <span style="color:#1e0e0e;"><i>DARK MAROON</i></span></li>
</ul>
<p>I feel that keeping in theme with disctric colors will help my intended audience view this as more of an official page.</p>
