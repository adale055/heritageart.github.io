<h2 style="background-color:#890000;color:#FFFFFF;">Purpose</h2> 
<p>The goal of my website is to connect parents, teachers, and the community to my art education program. I want my student's families, my collegues, my administration, and my local community members to know exactly what happens in our art room and the process of brining our creations to life.</p>
<p>My goals would be that people see exactly how much work goes into our art program and that it is invaluable to a child's whole education experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, my administration could check in on our hard work since they are not able to be in the classroom as much as I would like. THis will help reinforce my position as an art educator and ensure my administration I am meeting all of my expected goals.</p>
<p><b>Interview Questions:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>What would you like to see most on your child's art class website?</li>
<li>How will this website help connect you to your child's education experience?</li>
<li>What would you most like included on the website?</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>In talking with parents, I was able to see that some of them don't even know who their child's specials teachers are. This is a problem for me, because I want to be just as involved in each of my student's educational experience as their classroom teacher. The concensus was that an art website would help parents understand what goes on during their child's specials time and that we are actually teachers too.</p>
<p>It was also noted that having the lessons laid out for parents to see could really help open conversations between parents and their child about what they are doing in school. It would also help give parents the vocabulary necessary for working with their child at home on colors, shapes, lines, etc.</p>
