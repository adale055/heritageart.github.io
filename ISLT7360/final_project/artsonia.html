<p>Artsonia is a great resource for our school! It is an online art museum just for kids! Every week I post the latest artwork for you to see and share with family! Setting up an account is super easy and you can share the account with friends or family member as well!</p>
<p>Another great thing about Artsonia is the gift shop! You can purchase different items with your child's artwork printed on it. A portion of the proceeds goes directly back to me to help with the purchase of art supplies! This is a great opportunity for me to introduce your child to as many art resources as possible! Without your support it wouldn't be possible!</p>

  <blockquote>
<i>I love the art work that you have done and I really appreciate that that you take the time and effort to put it on Artsonia. I have two other granddaughters I Kansas City that I asked my daughter, who worked there, if there art teacher could get that. No, too much work. I love my bracelet I bought with my inserts. I’ll be able to see Baylee’s art work whenever I want. Hopefully you will be there when my next granddaughter, Sadie, gets there! -Janice Dominique</i>
