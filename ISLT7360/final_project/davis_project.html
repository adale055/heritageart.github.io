  This week we continued working on all of our amazing color projects! All of the kids are so proud of their work! Look at what we accomplished this week!
  <dl>
  <dt><b>Kindergarten Rainbow Pianos</b></dt>
  <dd>After learning painting procedures and painting their pianos with control, the kindergartenrs looked at real piano keys and added black strips of paper to their pianos in the correct pattern--Just like a real piano!</dd>

  <dt><b>1st Grade Chris Uphues Color Wheels</b></dt>
  <dd>1st graders are painting paper for their Chris Uphues inspired color wheels. They were give the three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) and were responsible for mixing their own secondary colors (green, purple, and orange)! So far they are looking amazing! Check back next week to see how we transform these papers!</dd>

  <dt><b>2nd Grade Op Art Rainbows</b></dt>
  <dd>The 2nd graders painted an entire piece of paper in all of the rainbow colors. They practiced neat painting techniques and worked on blending and smoothing their paint colors. Next week we will start drawing black and white Op Art to put on top of our rainbow!</dd>

 We're crazy about color! This week all students are learning about color! Check out our most recent work:
<dl>
  <dt><b>Kindergarten Rainbow Pianos</b></dt>
  <dd>The kindergarteners learned about the 7 colors of the rainbow and put their knowledge to practice by painting with watercolors on the keys of a piano! These beauties will be cut out and glued to black paper. Black keys will be added along with some music notes! Check out how they are coming along!</dd>
